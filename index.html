            <h2>Homepage<span>2022</span></h2>
            This is my Homepage that I made without any website builders,
            frameworks nor using any dependencies besides the tools listed on
            the bottom right. It features a list of my contact details, a photo,
            a scroll to top button and 4 clickable topics each having their own
            stylized content. The 4 big image buttons show a zoom effect on
            hover and every clickable link has a svg logo of the destination
            page and an expanding underline. Using media queries, it is able to
            dynamically change its layout according to the current window size.
            This being my first front end web project and only going by numerous
            html documentations I found on the internet, it took me quite a
            while to get it looking the way i envisioned it.

            Finding routes and departure times for any workday or freetime
            activity is repetitive and annoying. This is why I always wanted to
            develop my own android app that handles all these things as well as
            calculates and sets my wake up alarms, bed times and structures my
            available free time to efficently use for chores or remaining work.
            This app is far from being released as it is my largest project,
            I've self tought myself android development and I maintain the
            github repository and its own fully functional android CI/CD
            pipeline to run tests on an emulator and create a github release
            whenever I commit a new version code and release notes. Using no
            preset pipeline - just the free hosting service Azure Pipelines.

            <h2>TurnTimer<span>2020-2022</span></h2>
            Similar to the Organizer project, TurnTimer is an android app that
            was requested from a friend. The requirements were for it to be able
            to have multiple timers that count down alike a chess clock but for
            differnet board games and fully customizable. You can change the
            amount of timers, countdown or stopwatch mode, the start time as
            well as whether or not it should save the state on close. The app is
            fully released but I add occasional updates as new bugs, android
            versions or requirements emerge. It has the same pipeline as the
            Organizer project attached - automating the development process by a
            great margin. I also used this project to practise Test Driven
            Development (TDD) as I went along.

            Through the guidance of the ITSP-Services company and in a team of 3
            students with a teacher as the project mentor, we developed our
            final project of the HTL Salzburg. KeyS is a secure data management
            system with the goal of being able to securely share company
            internal licenses, passwords and important documents. The data is
            stored on a Database and can be accessed through a CLI-Tool or the
            webpage. There you can also modify the access permissions of users.
            My task was to develop the Client Library, CLI-Tool and design the
            cryptographic processes used.

            As the project in the subject "Hardware Development" in the second

            2 speakers. This works as the speakers emmit ultrasonic soundwaves
            that create a standing wave at specific intervals. I was working in
            a team of 2 - me and a classmate where I was responsible for the
            code running on the micro processor and helped with the design of
            the circuit board.

          <h2>Ballroom Dancing</h2>
          Started out as just visiting a youth class to meet people but I and
          Elena both realised that there had to more than just the social aspect
          and we seperately decided to visit the follow up advanced course where
          we met the first time and became partners. We slowly formed a very
          close friend group with other pairs and became more and more addicted
          to the feeling of improvement and showing it all off. Over the next 3
          years we visited balls, danced the openings in formations and even
          choreographed several ball opening dances ourselves to earn a little
          money on the side - but we mostly did it for the fun of it. The dance
          floor was our new home, practising almost every day of the week for
          2-6 hours at a time - whenever the dancing school was open. We could
          dance: Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Foxtrott, Tango, Slowfox, Rumba,
          Cha Cha, Samba, Jive, Paso Doble, Boogie, Salsa, Disco Samba,
          Rock'n'Roll and Discofox.

          <h2>Balls</h2>
          Luckily Elena shared the desire to dance on every ball we could and so
          begun the restless ball seasons. You see the austrian ball season
          streches from january to around may. And as opportunities arose to
          attend some for free or even perform on the dancefloor - we took them
          all. Sometimes even going on 3 in a single week, dancing late into the
          night after a school day or after two dancing classes on the weekend.

          After getting the chance to attend a dancing class to improve our
          technique, we quickly fell in love with the tournament or competitive
          dancing style which showed us a lot more room for improvement. 1,5
          years into extensive training on our own as well as 2 classes per week
          we decided to try out dancing in a real competition. But the global
          covid pandemic shut the event down 2 days afore.

          <h2>Ten Dance</h2>
          Looking through the many categories a competition had to offer we
          decided to stick with Ten Dance. It includes the 5 latin and 5
          standard dances that we already were familiar with and are commonly
          seen on a competition's dancefloor.
          <br />
          Standard: Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Tango, Quickstep, Slowfox
          <br />
          Latin: Rumba, Cha Cha, Samba, Jive, Paso Doble.

          is a cute black and white housecat with big ears. He is currently

          old and the most curious tom cat you can imagine. Although him being
          an apartment cat, I take him on occasional walks in the park and I am
          planning on cat proofing the balcony so he can enjoy the fresh air
          whenever he wants. It was not always easy raising a hyperactive cat in
          a small apartment as he woke us every morning at 5 am, biting our
          feet. He destroyed everything with his small teeth and would tear
          apart anything he found including some of Elena's favorite jackets. As
          he grew up began getting calmer although he still chases his favorite
          toy mouses in at hyperspeed through the apartment.

          <h2>Story</h2>
          My girlfriend's family found Mio abandoned on a parking spot - he was
          starving and not older than 3 months. They took him in but weren't
          able to keep him at their place and they didn't find someone else to
          take him in. I have always wanted to have a cat ever since I was a kid
          so my girlfriend and I decided to adopt him. Just a few weeks later he
          sat in our apartment - the cutest, most playful and affectionate cat
          in the whole world.

          fish in the morning and dipping into the cool blue ocean's water at
          noon. We also went stand up paddling and did some hiking over the

          I love doing backyard campfires with friends and throwing in any
          branch I can find. Over the years I have also been on the occasional
          snowboard trip, though I wouldn't say I'm great. My girlfriend and I
          love carving pumpkins and building snow animals together. The
          adventures I'm most proud of are everything I've done in the urbex

          or short urbex describes the act of exploring abandoned buildings,

          way too short parkour journey and it has fascinated me ever since.
          Climbing cranes and buildings, jumping across rooftops and just
