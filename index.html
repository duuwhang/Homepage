                        This is my Homepage that I made without any website builders, frameworks nor using any dependencies besides the tools listed on the bottom right. It
                        features a list of my contact details, a photo, a scroll to top button and 4 clickable topics each having their own stylized content. The 4 big image
                        buttons show a zoom effect on hover and every clickable link has a svg logo of the destination page and an expanding underline. Using media queries, it is
                        able to dynamically change its layout according to the current window size. This being my first front end web project and only going by numerous html
                        documentations I found on the internet, it took me quite a while to get it looking the way i envisioned it.

                        Finding routes and departure times for any workday or freetime activity is repetitive and annoying. This is why I always wanted to develop my own android
                        app that handles all these things as well as calculates and sets my wake up alarms, bed times and structures my available free time to efficently use for
                        chores or remaining work. This app is far from being released as it is my largest project, I've self tought myself android development and I maintain the
                        github repository and its own fully functional android CI/CD pipeline to run tests on an emulator and create a github release whenever I commit a new
                        version code and release notes. Using no preset pipeline - just the free hosting service Azure Pipelines.

                        Similar to the Organizer project, TurnTimer is an android app that was requested from a friend. The requirements were for it to be able to have multiple
                        timers that count down alike a chess clock but for differnet board games and fully customizable. You can change the amount of timers, countdown or stopwatch
                        mode, the start time as well as whether or not it should save the state on close. The app is fully released but I add occasional updates as new bugs,
                        android versions or requirements emerge. It has the same pipeline as the Organizer project attached - automating the development process by a great margin.
                        I also used this project to practise Test Driven Development (TDD) as I went along.

                        Through the guidance of the ITSP-Services company and in a team of 3 students with a teacher as the project mentor, we developed our final project of the
                        HTL Salzburg. KeyS is a secure data management system with the goal of being able to securely share company internal licenses, passwords and important
                        documents. The data is stored on a Database and can be accessed through a CLI-Tool or the webpage. There you can also modify the access permissions of
                        users. My task was to develop the Client Library, CLI-Tool and design the cryptographic processes used.

                        As the project in the subject "Hardware Development" in the second to last grade we developed an acoustic levitatior. The device lets small objects with a
                        low density float when you put them between the 2 speakers. This works as the speakers emmit ultrasonic soundwaves that create a standing wave at specific
                        intervals. I was working in a team of 2 - me and a classmate where I was responsible for the code running on the micro processor and helped with the design
                        of the circuit board.

                    <h2>Ballroom Dancing</h2>
                    It started out with me visiting a youth dancing class to meet people but Elena and I both realised that there had to be more than just social dancing. So we
                    seperately decided to visit the follow up advanced course where we met for the first time and became partners. We slowly formed a very close friend group with
                    other pairs and became more and more addicted to the feeling of improvement and showing it all off. Over the next 3 years we visited balls, danced the openings
                    in formations and even choreographed several ball opening dances ourselves to earn a little money on the side - but we mostly did it for the fun of it. The
                    dance floor was our new home, practising almost every day of the week for 2-6 hours at a time - whenever the dancing school was open. We could dance: English
                    Waltz, Tango, Quickstep, Slowfox, Viennese Waltz, Cha Cha, Rumba, Jive, Samba, Paso Doble, Salsa, and Discofox.

                    Luckily Elena and I shared the desire to dance on every ball we could and so begun the restless ball seasons. You see the austrian ball season streches roughly
                    from january to may. And as opportunities arose to attend some for free or even perform on the dancefloor - we took them all. Sometimes even going on 3 in a
                    single week, dancing late into the night after a school day or after two dancing lessons on the weekend.

                    After getting the chance to attend a dancing class to improve our technique, we quickly fell in love with the tournament or competitive dancing style which
                    showed us a lot more room for improvement. 1,5 years into extensive training on our own as well as 2 classes per week we decided to try out dancing in a real
                    competition. But the global covid pandemic shut the event down 2 days afore.

                    morning at 5 am, biting our feet. He destroyed everything with his small teeth and would tear apart anything he found including some of Elena's favorite
                    jackets. As he grew up began getting calmer although he still chases his favorite toy mouses in at hyperspeed through the apartment.

                    My girlfriend's family found Mio abandoned on a parking spot - he was starving and not older than 3 months. They took him in but weren't able to keep him at
                    their place and they didn't find someone else to take him in. I have always wanted to have a cat ever since I was a kid so my girlfriend and I decided to adopt
                    him. Just a few weeks later he sat in our apartment - the cutest, most playful and affectionate cat in the whole world.

                    <h2>Urban Exploration</h2>
                    or short urbex describes the act of exploring abandoned buildings, hidden places or high rooftops. I came across this hobby through my way too short parkour
                    journey and it has fascinated me ever since. Climbing cranes and buildings, jumping across rooftops and just wanting to know what lies behind that old factory
                    I've walked past my whole life.

                    As an austrian citizen, I absolved my 6 month mandatory military service in 2021. Although not having had a good time at all there and not really accomplishing
                    anything nor earning any savings during this time period, my relationship with my girlfriend grew a lot stronger.
