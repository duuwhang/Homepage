          <h2>Story</h2>
          My girlfriend's family found Mio abandoned on a parking spot - he was
          starving and not older than 3 months. They took him in but weren't
          able to keep him at their place and they didn't find someone else to
          take him in. I have always wanted to have a cat ever since I was a kid
          so my girlfriend and I decided to adopt him. Just a few weeks later he
          sat in our apartment - the cutest, most playful and affectionate cat
          in the whole world.
